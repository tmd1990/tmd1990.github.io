			Who is Troy Davis?
		</h1>
		<p>
			I was grew up in Florida, I went into the United Stated Air Force straight out of high school. I served 4 years as an Aircraft Armament Airman. In 2012 I seperated to pursue my education. I have an Associates Degree from Central Carolina Technical College in Engineering Graphics Technology. Now I am pursuing my B.S. in Information Technology from the American Military University.
		</p>
		<p>
			My hobbies are 3d Printing, web design, learning new programs, playing with my chihuahua Ronin. I also like being outdoors and exploring nature though I will admit I dont get out as much as I would like. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Today I oofer 3d Printing services, 3d model design, CAD design work, drafting, web design, and some software engineering. I created this site myself using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My intention is to use this site as a portfolio page while im in school, and to make some extra money from my experience and education.
